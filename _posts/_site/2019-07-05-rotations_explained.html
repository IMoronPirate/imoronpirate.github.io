<h1 id="rotation-matrix-from-veca-to-vecb">Rotation matrix from $\vec{a}$ to $\vec{b}$</h1>

<p>Usually $\vec{a}$ to</p>

<p>I work usually on two PCs one in the <del>office</del> and one at home. 
I have all my code in several git repositories hosted on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank">GitLab</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. 
Thus, when I implement some feature, let say in the office, 
I <code class="highlighter-rouge">push</code> the code to the host and then at 
home I <code class="highlighter-rouge">pull</code> the new code and <em>vice versa</em>.
In this way, I have always my code up-to-date in both stations.</p>

<p>A possible solution is to have a repository for the source code
and a repository for the hosting of the blog. However,
I did not like the idea of having two repositories for just one project.
So, I tought to use a branch for the developement into the main repository:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- dev <span class="c">#contains the source code to generate the blog</span>
- master <span class="c">#contains the html pages </span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The only issue is how to avoid the manually coping of the file generated
while you are in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">dev</code> branch and then commit those files in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>.
Thus, I wrote a rakefile to handle all of this</p>

<p>This post ends here, if you have comments/feedbacks drop me an <a href="mailto:i.moron.pirate@gmail.com">email</a>,
they are really appreciated.</p>

<p>Ciao!</p>
